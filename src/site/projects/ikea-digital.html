<p>This idea focuses around developing not only new kiosks but also integrating camera and sensor technology throughout the store to collect data on customer’s shopping habits in order to be able to recommend various other products and services offered by the company.<br>
This data can then be used with the kiosks to offer shopping list recommendations and promote relevant offers, so customers are less likely to forget products when they leave the store, providing an enriched user experience and increasing customer retention.</p>
